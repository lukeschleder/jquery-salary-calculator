# Employee Salary Calculator
---

## Description

Duration: 1 Weekend Sprint

This project created a employee salary calculator for use by employers.  This calculator takes in _employee first name, last name, ID number, job title, annual salary_.  When the submit button is clicked the calculator stores the  information, calculates monthly costs, and appends this to the DOM.  If the total monthly costs exceed $20,000, a red background color will display.  If you need to delete an employee from the DOM simple click the delete button on the right side of the page.  This calculator can help make sure your employee salaries are not impacting your bottom line.
