## Employee Salary Calculator
---

# Description

Duration: 1 Weekend Sprint

This project created a employee salary calculator for use by employers.  This calculator takes in _employee first name, last name, ID number, job title, annual salary_.  When the submit button is clicked the calculator stores the  information, calculates monthly costs, and appends this to the DOM.  If the total monthly costs exceed $20,000, a red background color will display.  This calculator can help make sure your employee salaries are not impacting your bottom line.

Directly above this is how long it took you to develop the project. Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

The application should have an input form that collects _employee first name, last name, ID number, job title, annual salary_.

A 'Submit' button should collect the form information, store the information to calculate monthly costs, append information to the DOM and clear the input fields. Using the stored information, calculate monthly costs and append this to the to DOM. If the total monthly cost exceeds $20,000, add a red background color to the total monthly cost.

Create a delete button that removes an employee from the DOM. For Base mode, it does **not** need to remove that Employee's salary from the reported total.
